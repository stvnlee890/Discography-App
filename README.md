# Search your favorite Artist

This project is a music discography application where you can search your favorite artists and learn more about them! This app uses React and the Discogs API for the contents displayed when users search an artist their curious about. My goal was to provide the users with  a search functionality so they can type the name of the musician theyâ€™re looking for and provide them with multiple results based on their input. From there, I wanted the users to be able to click on the cover images of the artists and display their information.

## MVP GOALS 

1.	Create an input field that will fetch the specified artist from the Discogs API.
2.	Be able to click on artist poster so the page can route the user directly to the artist profile page an display their information.
3.	Display multiple artists that match the keyword user inputs.
4.	Have a simple nav bar that can take users to the home page and results page through the input field.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
